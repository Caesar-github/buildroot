# WARNING!                                                                  #

# The "sync" option may not be a good choice to use with flash drives, as   #
# it forces a greater amount of writing operating on the drive. This makes  #
# the writing speed considerably lower and also leads to a faster wear out  #
# of the disk.                                                              #
#                                                                           #
# If you omit it, don't forget to use the command "sync" to synchronize the #
# data on your disk before removing the drive or you may experience data    #
# loss.                                                                     #

# It is highly recommended that you use the pumount command (as a regular   #
# user) before unplugging the device. It makes calling the "sync" command   #
# and mounting with the sync option unnecessary---this is similar to other  #
# operating system's "safely disconnect the device" option.                 #
