Subject: [PATCH 41/73] waylandsink: Fix for missing initial configure

We were doing our initial "empty" commit on the subsurface instead of the
toplevel surface. As an incidence, we should not have received a configure
event ever, not just on mutter. This fixes the following warning when using
mutter compositor (aka gnome-shell):

  waylandsink wlwindow.c:304:gst_wl_window_new_toplevel: The compositor did not send configure event.

(cherry picked from commit 56b56e43f30a6aecf39cc0b02688a88d6130c947)
